We arrived and the owner with her baby were so warm and welcoming and showed us the different rooms she had available. We opted for one that was furthest from the main road. It was simple with a hot shower, clean bed, and a/c that worked perfectly. The bed is a bit hard as some other reviewers have mentioned, but my partner likes hard beds so it worked out nicely. In the morning she made us tea and we drank it together while showing her some photos of our trip so far. I highly recommend staying here and helping out this family. Thank you!",

A purpose built cluster of home stays. They aren’t typical home stays really.\n\nSteep staircase to take luggage up. Very hard bed (fairly typical of a lot of accommodation options across Vietnam if not accomodating for western tastes)\nToiletries ok.\nPillows are very thin and limited quality (for western  comfort).\nThe worst aspect is the neighbouring property (Clay House) which has a large outdoor venue which allows parties of western tourists  until approx 1am. This wasn’t expected for a “home stay village”atmosphere.\nI suggest use home stay in other village or stay in a hotel in Meo Vac town centre.\n\nSeparate rooms are divided with doors and walls but no separate roof, so no sound proofing. Like a dorm with walls. One room door cannot be locked.",

The rooms don't have walls that go all the way up but rather a weird plastic window, so there's no privacy and you can hear everything. The bed is really hard and uncomfortable, there is no window in the bathroom rather than a hole.\nThere is a party hostel next door so there's loud music. And to top it all of there was a fan in the room that you can't turn off (we even asked the staff and they didn't know how to turn it off) and it was COLD. All in all it was a horrible experience",

As we were travelling with children, it suited us well to stay in one place for two nights rather than changing accommodation each night. We enjoyed being away from the main part of town, as it was quiet, and the evening walk into town was much appreciated after a day on the bikes. We had the best dinner, but agree that a bit more variety or additional breakfast options would be a good addition. The team was very attentive, and our children enjoyed the larger space downstairs. Bring warm clothes for the loop at this time of year, but you can look forward to a warm room and a hot shower in the evening. Thank you for a wonderful time and your company—it was perfect for us.",

They are very roomy and comfortable. The property itself looks very nice visually.\n\nFor breakfast they fed us banh mi with egg. I wish they provided us different food on the second day. It shouldn’t be the same breakfast both mornings. A hot bowl of phở would have been great since it was freezing inside the building. They don’t have heating in the main dining area. If management is reading this, please consider this idea.\n\nThe hotel is a bit away from the old town where all the action is. When I say a bit away I’m saying it’s about 15 mins walk.\n\nIf you’re coming here in November, bring warm clothes.",

None of the above though can compete with the warmth shown by the owners of the property. I truly felt at home, safe, comfortable and absolutely taken care of. The only bad thing about the place was the fact that I had to leave it. I’m definitely coming back over and over. It’s a dream home stay you should not miss it.",

However, the quiet hours policy from 10 PM ensures a peaceful night’s rest, and I didn’t experience any disturbances during my stay.\n\nOverall, KHÓI PANORAMA is an ideal choice for anyone looking to enjoy spectacular views and a unique wooden retreat.",

It’s clear that the owners are using the term \"homestay\" to deceive guests, as there’s nothing homely or family-like about this place. It’s purely a business, not a genuine homestay experience.\n\nThe price was incredibly high, much more expensive than the Hmong Village Resort where I stayed just the night before, which offered far better value for the money. The accommodation here does not justify the exorbitant cost.\n\nThe food was terrible—honestly, some of the worst I’ve had during my travels. I ended up going to a nearby town where I found much better food at a fraction of the price.\n\nI would not recommend this place to anyone looking for an authentic or good-value experience. Save your money and stay somewhere else.",

How do you feel if people can open your door disrupting your privacy?\n\nThe room has a small wood window but no glass to block insects from flying in!\n\nI give a generous 2 stars for its view of the beautiful mountains of Ha Giang!\n\nBottom line is I don’t recommend this place!",

Everything feels warm, authentic, and well thought out. The rooms are spacious, clean, and fully equipped, offering great comfort while still staying close to nature.\n\nOne highlight I really enjoyed was the food. The menu is surprisingly diverse, featuring both Asian and Western dishes, all prepared with care. A must-try is the bread dipped in mint honey – a unique local specialty that perfectly represents Hà Giang’s flavors.\n\nThe air in Hà Giang is incredibly fresh and cool, making it an ideal place to relax and recharge. Waking up surrounded by mountains and quiet scenery was incredibly refreshing.\n\nWhat made the experience even more special was the staff. They are local people – simple, genuine, friendly, and incredibly kind. Their warm smiles and hospitality made me feel truly welcomed.\n\nOverall, Hà Giang Aya Lodge is a perfect choice if you’re looking for a peaceful retreat that blends comfort, culture, and local charm. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Hà Giang 🌿",

        "content": "I was returning to Hanoi without staying overnight at Meo Bac, and I was so disappointed that I was looking for a place to stay nearby. A local guide recommended this place to me. Construction is currently underway, and the resort is being built in a state-of-the-art, luxurious style. There are approximately 7-8 buildings under construction, with about 3 completed. Because of the ongoing construction, I was able to find a cheap one-night stay. The entrance to the resort is easy to find, but if you're looking for the La Resort on Google Maps, it's located under the road, so you'll need to look carefully. Parking is available above ground for about 3 cars.\n\nThe resort entrance is luxuriously designed. However, keep in mind that construction is ongoing. According to a staff member, it's been underway for two years. Because it's a rocky mountain, equipment couldn't be brought in, so the work was done by hand. This gives the resort a well-organized feel. The Chopin furniture has an antique feel, reminiscent of a luxurious medieval design. The guest rooms are clean and the view from the window is particularly beautiful. The surrounding area, with few villages nearby, is incredibly quiet and peaceful. Evening The food and menu are reasonably priced, and each dish is incredibly luxurious and delicious. Eating outdoors while taking in the scenery was a truly new and wonderful memory.\n\nAfter finishing your meal, you head down to the first-floor lobby, where you'll find a perfect spot to unwind. Time flies by as you chat around the fire. The beds are incredibly comfortable, and the quiet surroundings make for a peaceful night's sleep. However, the roosters crow loudly in the early morning. This, too, is a nice touch, a testament to the country atmosphere. Breakfast and lunch are also excellent.",

Its location is also ideal, since it’s not in the centre of Dong Van, yet it’s in walking distance. Most important point: the genuine warm welcome from the whole family. Even with the language barrier, they were very keen to connect, exchange, and I truly enjoyed this positive attitude. The dinners they prepare for me were also a delight. Thanks again so much, I hope we see each others again :)",

Run by Tú and her cheerful staff, this hideaway offers a respite for the road-weary.\n\nWhen our scooter gang, The Pho Bros, rolled into the courtyard, we were greeted by sweeping views of mountain range, covered with lush jungle and a breeze that cooled the grit of the ride.\n\nThe beds strike a firm balance—l - enough to keep the spine straight but comfortable enough to drift off after a day of winding roads. Some rooms come with the quirky charm of a hand-held shower head sharing space with the toilet, turning the whole bathroom into a splash zone. If you’re particular about your showers, request one of the upgraded rooms.\n\nThe main street is just a short walk away, alive with bars, local joints, and the hum of a town tucked at the end of the world. Don’t miss the massage at the B&B though - 150,000 dong for 45 minutes of muscle-melting relief that works out the road’s aches.\n\nThe sauna, also offered at the B&B is a steamy escape, an electric experience that wraps you in waves of heat, loosening every tense nerve. It’s a place to sweat out the dust and feel alive again. Mornings bring a simple breakfast of eggs and rice, or a steaming bowl of pho - a fitting start to the day in this mist-laden town.\n\nThe Dong Van Bed and Breakfast isn’t just a place to rest; it’s a mountaintop stopover that captures the wild spirit of the journey.",

The room was basic, with bad lighting; the shower didn't drain properly so you end up with a pool of water where you use the toilet. Both nights we were disturbed by events going on. Breakfast was unacceptable – a fried egg on cheap white bread slices, with instant coffee. They offered a lump of condensed milk from a carton, because it had gone solid in the fridge. When I checked out, I told them 3 times that I didn't want breakfast, and just wanted to pay and leave, but they still got busy with the frying pan. Pool water was brown.",

        "content": "I only came up with a tour for the herbal bath, sauna, and massage combination package, so I’ll only comment on that.\n\nIn my experience, the resort is not suitable for the winter, especially if you have a sensitive nose. The town’s burnings are quite different from agricultural burnings that reset their fields. I got mildly sick with upper respiratory tract inflammation as a result of the particulate matter in the smoke coming through the resort.\n\nSecond, I’m not sure why the resort’s service quality is still at such a low level after so many years. I’ve traveled to 11 countries, and consider myself very experienced with different foods, drinks, and service standards. Even though the cost of the spa here is comparable to Thailand or Indonesia, the facilities and masseuse skills are very subpar. The details are as follows:\n\n- On a winter night, at 8 degree celsius, none of the floors were insulated or heated. Nor were we directed in any way by the clearly underaged staff milling around. The first time you step into the bath & sauna room, the floor is wet and mucky. It is 8 degree Celsius and very very cold. You strip off your clothes in that temperature, bare feet on the cold floor. In contrast, even tropical countries ensure they have a raised plastic floor to insulate against the cooler tiles.\n\nMind you, even tropical countries have that.\n\n- next, the young staff did not even reset or clean the rooms. For the price paid, you get cheap soap and shampoo sachets that were not even cleaned up. I counted 6 empty sachets on various places and had to clean them by myself.\n\n- third, the only instruction for operating the sauna also did not warn you to stay FAR AWAY from the metal box on the floor. I scalded myself when turning on the lever. For first time sauna users, It’s important to note that once the smoke fills the room, it smells and feels dry. So it is up to you to use the shower head to blast some humidity into the adjacent room; this is not machine operated.\n\n- fourth, for reasons unknown, the bath and sauna rooms have plainly exposed electrical sockets. Should you be using 120V chargers in a wet and moist environment with water splashing about?\n\n- fifth, some might argue that it a “cultural experience”, but even the Thai and Indonesians long ago adjusted their bathtubs to be LONGER and more ergonomic with a proper upper body and neck support.\n\n- sixth, before the massage, apparently none of the staff spoke English, and nobody wanted to proceed with service until my vietnamese friends volunteered to be translators.\n\n- 7th, for reasons unknown, the massage oil used had menthol despite it being winter. It was advertised as a hot ointment, so I was expecting something appropriate. Instead, once the initial heat from the menthol was gone, my friends and I were shivering in the aftermath cooling effect. Still, at least the young staff brought in thick blankets and a tiny heater?\n\n- 8th, the staff I had simply went through the motions of the massage, not understanding that her fingers were supposed to be applying direct pressure on muscle, instead of friction rubbing across my scalp.\n\n- 9th, to add more pain to the experience, my staff had long nails. Long nails. She clearly did not understand that she was scratching me either, since I had to remind her 3 times to be mindful of any motion that required her finger pressure.\n\nAll in all, would not go again.\n\nOh, did I mention the hotel lobby is exposed to the elements? Yeap. It is. Look at the pictures.",

It smelled of damp and even worse - of sewage. The bedding and towels were not very clean. There was no drinking water or toilet paper provided (very unusual in SE Asia). There was no air conditioner worked only occasionally. The fan didn’t work at all. The owners have 4 little boys that run around the halls screaming all day. And here’s the funny part. I gave them a bag of laundry to do and they lost my socks. I kept asking her if they’d been found. As we went to leave she asked for payment for the washing and I politely said I won’t pay if you’ve lost my socks. We were prevented from leaving; she had padlocked our motorcycles! A forty-five minute stand-off then ensued and the lady from the laundry showed up. She had CCTV footage from inside her laundry on her phone and claimed no socks were in my bag. But she messed up. My socks were clearly visible on her cameras. They had no choice but to unlock the bikes and let us go with the laundry bill cancelled. But it took nearly an hour to get there.\nAvoid this place at all costs!",

Hard beds, dirty kettles and the occasional blackout.\n\nWhen I asked if I could change my kettle to a clean one, the hapless staff realised that all their kettles were plagued with the same layer of unknown white muck. After which they suggested me to get my hot water from the lobby drink directly. The lobby was just a short walk from my room so I did just that a couple of times. During my stay in Dong Van, the power went out two times in quick succession. Both times, I heard some shouts in the lobby and the sound of a generator starting up, a good sign that at least the hotel is on top of blackout situations.\n\nEven though they speak little English, the staff are always ready to smile and ready to help. The hotel is actually situated on top of a mini mart so you have to go up some stairs to reach the hotel lobby. Sharing shopfront space with a shop on the first floor, bike parking tends to get a bit squeezy at times. For snacks, just walk out to the main road and turn right to find some good BBQ street food!\n\nMy room is big and have a heat insulated bathroom, although it can get noise from any commotion in the lobby, a nearby ktv at night and a construction site in the morning. Okay, that is actually not as bad as it sounds XD",

        "content": "Honestly not sure how this place has so many good reviews, the short version is you can find better accommodation for less in this area of Vietnam.\n\nPros: Appreciate the heating pad on the bed (since no ac or heating in room) and the bed itself was fairly comfortable. Good views over the valley and town albeit with trees blocking some of it.\n\nCons: The main critique we have of this place is the service. Couldn’t find someone to check in when we got there but even more so, the “included” breakfast was probably the saddest we’ve had traveling SEA. The coffee seemed like the dregs at the bottom of the pot that were scraped off and then had lukewarm water poured over them (not exaggerating), we left it and went into town for actual coffee. They didn’t have any sort of breakfast menu and just brought my husband some very sad “crepes” with white bread toast when he asked for breakfast. He managed to get me instant ramen noodles with one fried egg and greens by asking and pointing to others eating it.\n\nThis seems like a place riders in groups take their tourists, and it shows with them getting super drunk (one fell asleep and was snoring either his head on the table outside by 10:30 pm) and preferred treatment. My husband asked if he could get eggs in the morning like the ones the local guides were eating and they laughed in his face and walked away. The room was also incredibly NOT sound proof which mattered a lot because of the extremely loud karaoke (they seemed to cut people off at the actual hotel at 9:30 which was appreciated, but other places down the valley could easily be heard in the room until much later). The road in was pretty rough and broken up and if you didn’t have a scooter, there’s no way you’d be able to go into town. The front porch/sitting area by our room also seemed very unstable and swayed when walking across it.\n\nAll in all, not the worst place and feel bad for the lady who checked us in once we found her as she seemed a bit worn and overwhelmed. But again, can’t understand the reviews raving about this place unless we just happened to have a bad stay or the other reviews were asked for. Id recommend you go elsewhere if staying in the area during the Ha Giang loop.",

What’s even better is that all this came at a great price, making it an unbeatable value for the experience offered. Don Van Panorama Homestay truly exceeded our expectations in every way possible.

It was so loud I didn't sleep and i tried to contact owner.\n\nIn the am they did apologise and reduce room which was nice but a shame I had no sleep. The only other thing was the very very hard matress- maybe this was just my room though.\n\nI would definitely stay here again as my events were likely a one off-the location was excellent and the room was great.\n\nThey also don't take visa as it states on booking.com. lucky I had cash.",

The owner is always trying to help you, to check if everything is going well. If you need anything, he'll do everything he can to find a solution. He'll point you in the right direction for restaurants and things to discover in the area.\nThe rooms are simple but clean. The bed is large with a very hard mattress, but you sleep well.\nThere's a small terrace for a beer.\nA very nice little hotel with good value for money at €15 per night (no breakfast).\nI highly recommend it.\nJean-Pierre",

The homestay is surrounded by rice fields and mountains, offering stunning views. The rooms and bathrooms were clean and very comfortable. The entire building is unique and beautiful, full of character thanks to its history and traditional wooden architecture. The family is friendly, welcoming, and always helpful. Both dinner (a delicious vegetarian rice dish) and breakfast were abundant and tasty. Even the family dog is adorable, you just need to earn his trust little by little!",

The host has done an incredible job keeping the ancient charm alive while adding just the right amount of warmth, comfort, and modern convenience.\n\nThe owners are wonderful people. Mr. Thai is an excellent cook, every meal was delicious, beautifully presented, and made with heart. Ms. Kim is not only kind and charming, but she can also take you on small local adventures, from exploring village culture and gentle hikes through the forest and streams to more challenging treks up untouched mountain trails.\n\nThe homestay is also conveniently located, just a short distance from the Lung Cu Flag Tower: the northernmost point of Vietnam.\n\nAnd there’s also Em Ơi, their lovely dog, super smart, affectionate, and impossible to forget once you meet him.\n\nHighly, highly recommended!",

We will definitely be back. Thank you so much to all at Vieille maison de male for making our stay unforgettable.",

We booked two single rooms because nothing else was available, but they asked us if we wanted a double room and made everything ready really quickly. They also only charged us for the double room.\nBreakfast was really good, they made us a warm breakfast even though we were the only ones having breakfast!\nWe recommend this Homestay and would come back any time!!! 10/10",

The layout makes it easy to meet others and we even enjoyed family dinner with them. The dinner was tasty and big portions. The road was a bit precarious if you’re not confident due to a landslide a few months ago, but we heard there is another road that Google does not take you on - so maybe contact the hosts for directions to avoid this difficult road. :)",

We were the only guests that night, and we really liked that. The bedroom is separated by curtain as you sleep in the same area as the family.\nWe were also provided a fan and a mosquitoes net.\nHomemade food was delicious, and we paid 500 000 for dinner + breakfast + bed for 2. The area is very quiet with a beautiful view on the mountains, and the family has 2 dogs, cat, and chickens on the property. The evening ended with a small karaoke (they have professional equipment), which was a lot of fun.\nThe only negative I need to mention is the mattress, which was very hard. It is a personal preference, i guess. My partner was ok with it, but for me, it was too hard. That's the only reason that I can't give it 5*",

In comparison to other home stays on the loop, we just had the impression as we were the only ones, they were not so keen to make a lot of conversation. The food was good, though there were not so many different dishes. It was also not as clean as we found it elsewhere. For example there was quite some dust in the rooms which could have easily been swept. The surroundings are lovely with great views and to be fair, it could all really be related to the fact that we were the only guests... Breakfast was good.",

What was a bit unusual was that, perhaps because it's located right on the Chinese border, the dishes served were similar to Chinese food. Our Western friends enjoyed the flower buns so much that they kept asking for refills. The owner, seeing our guests enjoying their meal, was pleased and offered us more.",

Perhaps because of this, my room was automatically changed from a dormitory to a private room. Dinner was an additional 80,000 VND. At night, there were rats running around on the ceiling above my room, making a lot of noise. In the middle of the night, I could often hear the voices of the family and children living there. I don't know if this was just one night or if it's like this every night, but they seem to be sleeping and waking up on the same floor as my guest room.",

I'd never seen anything so dirty.\n- We weren't invited to dinner. We were the only two foreigners, and it was noticeable. Once night fell, no one came to see us to ask if we needed anything.\n- Before going to sleep, we tried to shower, but the showers/toilets were also very dirty. Furthermore, there was no hot water after 3 minutes in the middle of winter.\n- While sleeping, we had to mention the rats running around (it wasn't our imagination; we saw them) and the accommodation was so poorly insulated that it must have been 0 degrees Celsius in the room in the middle of winter. No heating. - The next day, for breakfast, I found plastic in my instant noodle soup...\n\nHowever, I would like to acknowledge the kindness of the man who welcomed us and compensated us for the cut at breakfast. However, apologies aren't everything.",

When it arrived there were fleas all over it. Very gross. We were put on the 5th floor and in the middle of the night someone tried to come into our room. Not sure if it was an accident or what but our door was definitely rattled. Very noisy hotel as well. Stains all over the walls. Would not stay here again, nor would I advise anyone to stay here.\n\nIn addition, after I left, I noticed my wallet was no longer in my possession. Being that we were doing the Ha Giang Loop, I did not notice until about 60 km's down the road. We called the hotel and said they would have the wallet sent to our hostel in Ha Giang. 2 days later the wallet was never delivered and the hotel gave a \"wrong number\" for the bus that they sent the wallet on.

It makes you wonder if they even clean the place. Unfortunately, it was already so late that we didn't want to change hotels. When we asked who would clean the bathroom, the owner said she would... but she didn't.\n\nThe toilet is also not designed for taller people (you'd bang your knees on the wall).\n\nI've often experienced bathrooms in hotels that weren't completely clean or the bedspreads had been reused, but for the 800,000 VND they were offering, it should be of a different standard! Because of these issues, we were able to negotiate the price down to 500,000. Still, I really don't recommend it!",

Room was clean but nothing special.\n\nI think if your'e looking for a homestay experience, you may want to look elsewhere. This place just felt like a local motel with average service.",

By the time we arrived there's a group of 20 people intended to stay but due to their old age and the dorm’s condition was unsuitable to them so they left. And the owner told us that we could stay here.\nWhen we checked the room, this is a different room that he had sent us in the messenger, this room is an open area where people can go through, we felt uncomfortable about this and requested to change to the room in the picture that he sent. But he rejected , he said that we could choose to stay or left, whatever and his reason was our low deposit (this is his request when we asked, and at this moment he was acting like this was our fault, we can pay 50% or more for the deposit but the point is the attitude of the owner).\nSo we decided to leave and find another homestay to spent a night in Dong Van.",

But for a 3-star Vietnamese hotel, it's very good for its category and as good as some I've stayed in in France or elsewhere in Europe.",

If there is an award in noise pollution this place for sure wins it in all hotels I stayed the last 5months: 1. subbass-sound of the AC & toilet from another room 2. you will hear people speaking in the other rooms/ in the reception, as the sound isolation is very bad and the corridors make it even louder 3. super annoying elevator sound even hearable 2 levels away, you hear each time somebody uses the elevator 4. opening/closing doors is superloud too as of the loudness effect of the corridor\n\nEven with earplugs not possible, so sadly the nice ppl who work there cant make this circumstances bettter,  so under the line I cannot recommend this place!p I stayed in basic places the 2 days ago for the half price that were more comfy and more quiet, proper rest is very important if you drive many hours a day, in this hotel you will not find it so choose another place!",

The rooms were warm, clean, had AC too, comfy beds, and private bathrooms — all of which aren’t always easy to come by while doing the loop. There was a secure place to park our bikes as well. Literally around the corner from the market street in town and restaurants. It’s run by a lovely family who are very friendly and just opened a month ago, and helped us with all our requests. Would recommend to anyone passing through Meo Vac.",

Even though we left from Dongban and arrived around 10 o'clock, they prepared in advance and allowed us to check in early, so we could leave our luggage in the room and ride around the area comfortably. It was the only place that allowed early check-in during the 7-day Hajang, Dongban, Meo Vac, Bao Lac, Dujia itinerary. The daughter who usually works at the counter is pretty because she resembles her mother. Meo Vac is not that big, but it's near the main street where the Meo Vac market is, so we had a good stay for 2 days. If I go to Meo Vac again next time,,,, 1) The double room has a large window so it's good to see the Meo Vac street, and 2) The standard twin room is a little narrow, but the bathroom was bigger than the double room.",

The staff is helpful, kind and charming, they took care of us with dedication despite the language barrier.\nThey took care of us with a delicious vegetarian dinner, and went above and beyond to ask if we were avoiding any other foods to adjust the meals for us.\nWe had a great time!\nThe only thing that was a little complicated was the hot water in the room, which ran out after one shower and we were unable to heat it up again.\nHowever, highly recommend! We sat and watched the sunset from the room's balcony, it was unforgettable.",

The Loop is quite a tough and adventurous multi-day motorbike trip, but staying at this resort really made it worth it. The resort itself is luxurious and perfect for resting after a long day of riding.\n\nThe staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the resort had many great facilities, including a tennis court, a beautiful outdoor pool, and a stunning infinity pool that overlooks the gorgeous surrounding landscape. It’s the perfect spot to unwind and take in the views.\n\nThe wooden cabins are really cool and add a nice rustic touch to the experience, even though they’re a bit small and not the most functional. Still, they fit perfectly with the vibe of the place and definitely make the stay unique. The restaurant on-site serves excellent food, and I found it to be some of the best I had in the area.\n\nOverall, Hmong Resort is a perfect blend of comfort and adventure. If you're doing the Loop, I highly recommend staying here – it's the ideal place to relax and recharge before continuing your journey!",

This is a £60 a night room and it’s definitely not with that. There is no Tv, no Air-conditioning. If you are Western there is no offering of breakfast. We have travelled extensively throughout Vietnam and my opinion this would be great at £25 and would be value. They seem to be taking advantage of the treat yourself moment and booking the most expensive thinking you will get something a little nicer.",

This place is located in the ‘tourist’ village, about 10 mins from Meo Vac town but only a few minutes from the boat rides. It’s in the section where construction has been completed. We opted for dinner here almost very night and They were delicious. Breakfast was great too! And the family were so genuine and caring. They made our stay truly memorable and special.

She even arranged a bus to take his broken bike back to the rented place in Ha Giang while I was on the tour. She's really gone above and beyond the call of duty. I'm very grateful and glad to know her.\nThe hotel is overlooking the rice fields that will definitely give you a calm and pleasant feelings. Apart from the hotel, there is also a place for you to keep your bike as well as an eating area that can accommodate up to 50 people, and the homemade meals are cheap and very delicious. Our room had two double beds for a very reasonable price, and the restroom has a shower with hot water, a decent size TV and WIFI access, of course.\nNext to the hotel is a motorbike rental shop.  The owner is named Hieu, she is very helpful and she also has a great deal of knowledge in a variety of motorbikes. Most of them are new but the rental prices are very reasonable . Basically, this hotel has all the amenities and various services that it provides to its guests to enhance their stay and provide most comfort and convenience. If you ever visit Đồng Văn, I strongly recommend you stay here. You won't be regret it",

The host spoke perfect English and was very organised and accommodating of any specific changes we discussed. All the staff were competent and made everything very easy for us as well as being inviting and making us feel looked after. A laundry service is offered which returned my clothes dry the very next morning before my checkout. I told the host what times we wanted our meals to be ready and they were always perfectly on time. The cook created us and provided very tasty food which we all enjoyed. The host also took our dietary considerations seriously which meant we all had a good meal. The homestay is part of a larger complex but is on the quiet site. This is the best of both worlds as you can stay in the quiet or take a 5 minute walk to one of the other homestay rented by Jasmine Hostel tours and enjoy a fun party with western guests also doing the Ha Giang tour. There is a a bar serving drinks all night at the party.",

The rooms aren't very pretty and the location of the hostel is nothing special, but the rooms are clean, the mattress was comfy and there was a mosquito net.

The bathrooms were spacious, and although parking was limited, I could park my motorbike in front of the hostel. Their dinner (100k/person) was great, and the breakfast (included) was not bad either. Just like other \"homestays\", this is another commercialized homestay too, and I'm not being fuzzy about it.\n\nPersonally, during my particular stay, there was a large group of other guests in my dorm who were loud / playing card games and kept lights on until 2AM. They also woke up early to leave at around 5AM, followed by the staff loudly cleaning up the place, so my sleep wasn't particularly good. I understand it's probably just one unfortunate night, but the whole village indeed seems to attract those who enjoy a night with karaoke.",

You also have a nice view over the town and the mountains there.\nIn the morning you can get a big and yummy breakfast and I also recomend joining Yen's family for dinner with lots of traditional local dishes in the evening!\n\nYen was a great host and without her advice I would probably have missed some of the most beautyful places of my trip. I really recomend to stay here for more than just one night because there are lots of hidden beautyful places to explore in the area and you can learn a lot about the local culture here. I also enjoy looking back to the wonderful evenings with interesting conversations and fun cooking :D\n\nThank you for hosting me at your place!

At 8 o clock in the morning cleaners started being really loud hoovering running around and laughing playing radio which was very loud as one of the walls in the room is a glass door which made it sound even louder. Check out was at 11 o clock but from 8 you couldnt sleep in this noise. Constant lack of hot water. They tell everyone to turn hot water off after shower so when you want to shower you switch it on and it takes ages to warm up at the end we gave up and had a cold shower.

The breathtaking views of the mountains within the sorroundings, the culture and way of living of these people really make you having to stop at Meo Vac.\n\nYên speaks fluent English which is very uncommon these days in Vietnam. She will help you by advising the best adventures around Meo Vac and by providing you a very comfortable and safe accomodation. I also recommend to stay for dinner. It's so delicious and always in abundance. I had several family dinners throughout many homestays in Vietnam and this one was definitely the best.\n\nI wish all the success for the volunteering program that Yên is running at her homestay. I hope in the future many kids in Meo Vac can fluently speak English and thus improve their life quality by having way more opportunities than in the past. Phuong is an example of it.\n\nI will definitely try to visit you guys in the near future!\n\nFrancisco",

He gave us all kinds of directions about the hotel, where to eat in town, and some alternative routes we could take in the area. He was always super polite and even took the time to speak to us in our language.\nThe hostel itself is very nice. The private room is a good size, with a comfortable bed and a small table to put your things. The room, bathroom, and other facilities are always spotless. The shower is fantastic because it has hot water and perfect pressure.\nThe only negative is that we were a little cold inside the hotel, although truth be told, that's something we experienced throughout the entire loop. Nowhere has central heating or heating in the room, and sometimes you feel colder inside the hotel than outside.\nIt's worth noting that they have a parking lot where you can safely store your motorcycle at night, and the place closes around 10 p.m., so you can't come and go as you please.\nThe only thing we didn't like was the breakfast. The coffee was good, but the pho was from a packet (a packet of pho in Vietnam!!! :( )), and the crepes were quite bland and cold because they're prepared in advance.\nOtherwise, we quite liked the place, and Meo Vac was one of our favorite places in the Loop.",

However, you can't go to a restaurant for dinner because the hot pot prepared here is SPECTACULAR! Plus, the cozy atmosphere at dinner is sure to make you want to stay.\nDon't forget to have breakfast here either, as it has plenty of options and all are carefully prepared with great care.\nRegarding volunteer opportunities, if you're interested, ask about them because it's a unique experience.\nI spent an incredible month both with the school children and at the homestay reception. Yen's initiative is to offer children this opportunity so they can continue their studies and find good jobs in the future, or want to continue their studies.\nSo, thank you so much for this whole month, to you and your whole family, because you're all amazing, you've made me feel like one of you.",

I did get a room on the south side, so when I arrived it was extremely hot, but not much of a problem. Water (small bottles) and a kettle are also provided. The owner was also very nice and helpful, even though he doesn’t speak English.\n\nVery clean, good location, and quiet. Definitely worth staying here!",

The toilet flush and the shower are especially loud. The shower is very close to the toilet, and the wastewater from the sink runs from a pipe towards the drain in the bathroom. The bathroom is always a bit damp. The bed is comfortable. Pillows are a bit high. Great value for money and really good for one night. The balcony was nice too.",

Simple but well-thought. The bathrooms are well-designed and bring comfort you wouldn’t expect in Meo Vac.\n\nAbove all, Ms. Cuc made us feel at home, by preparing grilled food, discussing with us, giving advice on our trip, and truly caring with her smile.\n\nI cannot recommend this place enough. Suitable for solo travelers, families, and even bigger groups (we came with our 4 drivers, so 8 persons in total).",

He ate and broke my backpack, as well as one of my t shirt. After that he was running crazy inside of our room, under the bed, on the walls and (no joke) on the ceiling. We spent the rest of our night waiting in the lobby in order to check out. Please go somewhere else, this place is not equipped for the service they propose.",

It’s very nice to see, but can be very loud when you want to relax in your room. ;)\n\nFor sure stay for dinner here, because the food was incredible!",

As they said, they are only english speaker in village, but the lady does not speak english at all. During the night something bite my  hair brush and purse, lucky for me,  ruind only the purse and sun cream and not the documents I had inside. The breakfast was included, the lady accidently put it on bill, after I told her it should be included, she remove the food, but left the cofee and tee( persume it should be part of breakfast, but not want to argue and left place asap). So not recomended to stay!",

There are few obstacles though, which are worth paying attention. 1) If you do not posess permit, you would not be allowed to stay there. 2) A bit pricey, 100K per bed. 3) No food, you better look for it in the city. (Beware, some restaurants explicitly offer dog meat, so if you are not fans, pay attention) On the bright side - you are supporting the local Lolo community, which is allegedly the most impoverished in the whole Vietnam. The change in Sang Pa A is visible. The \"traditional Lolo houses\" were replaced by the concrete ones, bit the peoples' lives obviously got better. The staff do not speak English, but they are incredibly helpful, the Google Translate will do the job. So don't be shy, ask about everything you are interested, the locals will appreciate it.

We also saw a mouse crawling across the ceiling several times during the night.\n\nWe had booked breakfast included. The owner asked if we wanted tea, and we said we preferred coffee, which was no problem. When we paid for the room, we had to pay for the coffee because it wasn't included in the breakfast, which was really unacceptable.\n\nWe've been traveling for a long time and aren't exactly fussy travelers.

Maybe quieter :)\n\n(The last photo is from the homestay on the right, all the others are from the homestay on the left.)",
